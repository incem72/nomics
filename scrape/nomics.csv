"Bitcoin (₿) (BTC) is a decentralized virtual digital currency that can be sent between users through the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. It was the first example of a cryptocurrency, a growing asset class that shares some characteristics of traditional currencies, but has verification based on cryptography.  The term ‘Bitcoin’ can refer to the token (a snippet of code that represents ownership of a digital value) or it can refer to the technology (a distributed network that maintains the ledger of balances of the Bitcoin token).  The idea for Bitcoin and blockchain was first published in an online cryptography forum in November 2008, by an anonymous person (or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto. The white paper, entitled ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ outlined an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof, and explained how the different parts of the Bitcoin protocol would operate and be kept secure. It further described how a new type of database called a blockchain would keep track of the history of all Bitcoin transactions, and be maintained by everyone in the network.

"Ether (ETH) (Ξ) is a cryptocurrency whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum network. Unlike Bitcoin, which aims to disrupt the banking system with its own digital currency, the Ethereum platform’s goal is to use blockchain to replace internet third parties, particularly those that store data, transfer mortgages, and keep track of complex financial instruments. Ethereum is open-source, public, and highly programmable. Anyone can use or modify its software to build upon the computing platform and operating system. The platform gives developers the opportunity to build their own digital assets on the Ethereum infrastructure without having to create their own blockchain. This has given rise to hundre...ds of Ethereum blockchain based tokens (such as Binance Coin, Golem, and Basic Attention Coin). In 2017, at the height of crypto-mania Ethereum was leading blockchain platform for Initial Coin Offering  (ICO) projects, with over 50% market share.

"Tether (₮) (USD₮) is a cryptocurrency with digital tokens designed to replicate the value of the United States Dollar. The theory is that this provides protection from the volatility of cryptocurrencies, so 1 USD₮ will always be worth $1. To achieve this Tether claims to have each token backed 100% by actual assets in the platform’s reserve account.  The origins of Tether came from a whitepaper published online in January 2012, in which software developer J.R. Willett described the possibility of building new currencies on top of the Bitcoin protocol. Credited with ‘inventing the ICO’ to fund the project, Willett went on to implement his idea in the form of the ‘Mastercoin’. The Mastercoin protocol became the technological foundation of the Tether platform. Tethers exist on blockchains using the Omni Protocol, and as ERC20 tokens.  Two original members of the Mastercoin Foundation, Brock Pierce and Craig Sellars, became co-founders of Tether. Former child actor, Brock was a minor partner in a digital entertainment network that raised $88 million in venture capital in the 1990s. In 2013, he joined brothers Bart and Bradford Stephens in founding the venture capital firm Blockchain Capital (BCC) which was reported to have raised $85 million in two venture funds by October 2017.

"USD Coin (USDC) is an asset-backed stablecoin pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio.  Each USD Coin is collateralized with a US dollar that is held in regulated financial institutions which are monitored and audited on a monthly basis.  USDC is an alternative to other US dollar-backed cryptocurrencies like Tether (USDT) and TrueUSD (TUSD).USDC was created and launched in September 2018 by CENTRE, an open-source consortium developing a decentralized network of fiat stablecoins.

"Binance Coin (BNB) is a cryptocurrency issued by the popular trading platform Binance. The coin runs natively on the Ethereum blockchain and follows the ERC20 technical token standard. It is classified as a utility token and can be used on the Binance exchange.  In July 2017, Binance held an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB which helped it to raise $15 million. During the ICO process, the company offered 10% of the total number of coins (BNB 20 million) to angel investors, 40% (BNB 80 million) to the founding team, and the remaining 50% (BNB 100 million) to other participants. Holders of the BNB coin are referred to as Binancians.

"XRP is the native digital asset of the Ripple platform. Ripple aims to connect banks and payment providers to provide a frictionless experience for sending and receiving money globally. It was originally designed as a day-to-day payment system, to speed up and reduce the costs of transactions, and provide a mediatory currency for exchanges and conversions with minimum commission.  Software developer Ryan Fugger founded the original Ripple project in 2004. The core idea behind the protocol was a peer-to-peer trust network of financial relations that would replace banks. Based on the premise that money is simply a bank’s promise of value, he aimed to create a monetary system where the promise of an individual held just as much weight. His concept was launched in 2005 as RipplePay, a financial service allowing users to extend credit lines to friends and family and make secure payments in traditional and online currencies.

"Dogecoin (DOGE) is a blockchain-based peer-to-peer cryptocurrency which was created in December 2013, as a tongue-in-cheek riposte to Bitcoin, and the crypto world generally. Its branding featured a likeness of a Shiba Inu dog from a ‘Doge’ meme that was popular at the time. By January 2014, it had quickly and unexpectedly generated a large community following and had reached a market capitalization of $60 million.  The idea for Dogecoin was conceived by Jackson Palmer, a marketer at Adobe Systems in Sydney, who tweeted a joke concept combining two of the internet's most talked-about topics: cryptocurrency and Doge. Billy Markus, a Portland, Oregon-based gaming geek and IBM software developer, made the concept a reality. According to Markus, it took him about three hours to create Dogecoin.  Markus based Dogecoin on an existing cryptocurrency, Luckycoin, which features a randomized reward that is received for mining a block, although this was later changed to a static block reward in March 2014. In turn, Luckycoin is based on Litecoin, which also uses scrypt technology in its proof-of-work algorithm. He simply changed a few core elements, including replacing the word ‘mine’ with ‘dig’ (because that’s what dogs do).

"Launched in 2017, Cardano is a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project which is fully open source and was built to support the creation of decentralized financial applications (dApps). It claims to have more advanced features than any protocol developed and to have the first currency to evolve out of scientific philosophy, academic theory, and peer-reviewed research. Appropriately, the platform takes its name from Gerolamo Cardano, an Italian polymath who is regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the Renaissance.  The native cryptocurrency of Cardano is called Ada (ADA), named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician (and daughter of Lord Byron) who is often referred to as the first computer programmer. The currency is integrated natively into Cardano’s settlement layer, making it an essential part of the platform; however, this is something that Cardano reportedly intends to supersede.

To solve this issue, oracles are used.An oracle finds and verifies real-world events and submits this data to smart contracts on the blockchain.  Although oracles help, they also present another point of concern: oracles are centralized third-party sources.  A user must trust that the oracle is providing accurate data.  This is called the “oracle problem.”",ChainLink,LINK,0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca,https://chain.link/,https://link.smartcontract.com/whitepaper,https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca,,https://twitter.com/chainlink,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chainlink/,https://t.me/chainlinkofficial,,,,https://blog.chain.link/,,
"Cosmos (ATOM) is a decentralized network of independent blockchains, each powered by Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms.  Atom is the native staking token of the Cosmos Network.  The Cosmos vision is to build an “internet of blockchains” that can scale and interoperate with one another.  Open source tools like Tendermint Core, the Cosmos SDK, and the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) were created to accelerate the creation of blockchains in the Cosmos Network.Tendermint Core is a BFT consensus algorithm.  With the Tendermint consensus algorithm, users get “instant finality,” which means forks are never created as long as more than a third of the Validators are honest.  Transactions are finalized as soon as a block is created (unlike proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum).The Cosmos SDK is a generalized framework that simplifies the process of building secure blockchain applications on top of Tendermint Core.  IBC is a protocol that connects independent blockchains together.  IBC allows heterogeneous chains to transfer value or data to each other and can work with any “fast-finality” blockchain engine.",Cosmos,ATOM,,https://cosmos.network/,,https://www.mintscan.io/,,https://twitter.com/cosmos,,https://reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork,https://t.me/cosmosproject,,,https://blog.cosmos.network/,,https://www.youtube.com/c/CosmosProject,

"Monero (XMR) is a secure, private, and untraceable digital currency. Although it offers the option of transparency, it is typically known for its use of privacy technologies such as ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and stealth addresses to obscure the origins, amounts, and destinations of transactions.  You can buy Monero from an exchange or from an individual. Alternatively, you can mine Monero to get coins from the block reward. Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol. Unlike Bitcoin, where people can see exactly how much money is being sent from one user to another, Monero hides this information to protect user privacy. Monero also features a dynamic block size and dynamic fees, an ASIC-resistant proof of work, and a tail coin emission.  Monero’s Kovori is an anonymized router which integrates I2P technology and has been under development since 2015. The project will improve the privacy of the network by hiding the IP addresses of those who wish to interact with the Monero blockchain.  Due to the stringent privacy features, Monero experienced rapid market capitalization growth in 2016, far surpassing that of other cryptocurrencies. This was reportedly due to its adoption by the darknet market and rightwing extremists.

"Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a second generation blockchain, a network, a community, and a cryptocurrency. In addition to allowing people to send amounts of value to each other, ETC allows for complex contracts that operate autonomously and cannot be modified or censored.  Both Ethereum Classic and Ethereum (ETH) have a value token called ‘Ether’, which can be transferred between participants, stored in a cryptocurrency wallet, and used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed on the Ethereum Platform.  The Ethereum concept was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer in late 2013. Development was funded by an online crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014, with the Ethereum system going live on 30 July 2015.  Two years after Ethereum’s launch there was a hack which caused a split in the community, often described as a ‘battle of ethics and ideology’. The victims were investors in a fund called the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), which was launched by the Ethereum community as a decentralized investment fund for smart contract projects.

"Stellar is a platform that connects banks, payments systems and people, helping them to move money across borders at almost no cost. It acts as a bridge facilitating the low-cost trading of fiat currencies, particularly in cases where there might not be a large direct market.  The native asset of the Stellar network is the Lumen (XLM). Lumens are used to pay transaction fees on the platform and act as a security measure that mitigates DoS attacks that attempt to generate large numbers of transactions or consume large amounts of space in the ledger. The asset also plays an anti-spam role, as all user accounts must hold a minimum of 0.5 Lumen, discouraging abandoned accounts and ensuring that they all have economic utility.  In 2014, when the network launched, the native asset was also called ‘Stellar’ but was renamed ‘Lumen’ in 2015 to prevent confusion. The supply of Lumens is governed by strict protocol-level rules. At launch 100 billion were created and every year new Lumens are added to the network at an inflation rate of 1%.  The platform and development of the network are run by the Stellar Development Foundation, a non-profit and non-stock fund.

It was created in 2017 after the Bitcoin community split in two (or hard-forked) over scalability issues. The plan for a Bitcoin alternative was pushed through by Bitcoin activists, investors, entrepreneurs, developers, and largely China-based miners. It was considered to be one of the most successful hard-forks of the original Bitcoin. At the time of the fork, anyone owning Bitcoin was also given the same number of Bitcoin Cash units.  Bitcoin Cash increases the size of blocks, allowing for more transactions to be processed.

"Originally designed as an Ethereum staking solution, the Lido decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) was established on December 19, 2020.  Later it turned into a decentralized staking platform supporting ETH 2.0, Terra, Solana, Kusama, and Polygon.  The other cryptocurrencies were added later as well.  At the time of writing, this is the market leader for Ethereum liquid staking that takes a great share of all staked ethers.The project offers a simplified and secure staking option for digital assets, in which the annual percentage rate (APR) depends on the chosen token.  Rewards are proportional to the size of the user's stake compared to the total amount of the locked coins while the balances are updated on a daily basis.  The minimum deposits for staking are not defined, and participants are not required to maintain the platform’s infrastructure which significantly reduces the entry barriers for newcomers.

"Bitcoin SV is short for Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV) and is a cryptocurrency that claims to be closer to the original Bitcoin template as envisioned by its creator. The idea for Bitcoin and blockchain was first published in an online cryptography forum in November 2008, by an anonymous person (or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto.  The white paper, entitled ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ outlined an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof, and explained how the different parts of the Bitcoin protocol would operate and be kept secure. It further described how a new type of database called a blockchain would keep track of the history of all Bitcoin transactions, and be maintained by everyone in the network.  Bitcoin was first released as version 0.1 in January 2009, by Satoshi and was published on SourceForge, an online collaboration platform for developers. In 2017, the Bitcoin community split in two (or hard-forked) over scalability issues and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created which increased the size of blocks, allowing for more transactions to be processed.

"Synthetix develops a blockchain-based payment network fueled by a stable coin aiming to combine all the benefits of a decentralized approach with the stability of traditional financial assets.  In order to reach stability, the project implements a dual token solution that consists of a stabilized Ethereum-based utility token SNX and a reserve token Nomin to back it.  Nomin is pegged to the value of 1 USD and is used to make transactions on the platform.  Previously known as Havven, the project was rebranded in November 2018, and now bears the name of Synthetix.  It is fueled by a native ERC-20 cryptocurrency SNX.On the Synthetix platform, SNX tokens serve to stabilize and collateralize the system, while their holders get the transactions fees.  The size of payouts depends on their contribution to the stability of the Nomin token.  SNX token holders place their assets in an escrow account in order to issue Nomins, as the total value of SNX in escrow is always bigger than the value of Nomins in circulation.  The collateral ratio of nomins to SNX equals to 1:5.  This helps to ensure that nomins can always be redeemed for their face value even if the price of SNX dramatically drops.",Synthetix Network Token,SNX,0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f,https://www.synthetix.io/,https://www.synthetix.io/uploads/havven_whitepaper.pdf,https://etherscan.io/token/0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f,https://github.com/havven/havven,https://twitter.com/synthetix_io,,https://www.reddit.com/r/synthetix_io/,,,,,https://blog.synthetix.io/,,

It was one of the first digital currencies to feature a decentralized blockchain governance system. It rebranded again in March 2015; its new name is an amalgamation of the words ‘digital cash’.  The coin was created as a result of a Bitcoin fork in an attempt to improve on efficiency, speed, and anonymity. It is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, claiming to be the perfect option for people who are not interested in cryptocurrency. Transactions have low fees and are much faster than Bitcoin.  Dash coins are obtainable through mining, running the network as a masternode, or by exchanging them for other tokens and fiat currencies. Anyone can form a masternode if they hold 1000 Dash in collateral. If a miner is willing to perform advanced functions (such as increased privacy and instant transactions) they can earn a 45% block reward. In April 2018, Dash's market capitalization was around $4.3 billion, it was one of the top 12 cryptocurrencies and its peer-to-peer network was one of the largest in the world.

At this, the platform offers spot and derivatives trading, OTC, lending services, etc.  In order to enhance the trading experience of its users, BTSE launched a utility token with the same name.  Unlike many other exchanges that feature Ethereum-based utility assets, BTSE issues its token on Liquid, a Bitcoin sidechain-based network created for traders and exchanges.  This provides token users with a number of benefits.  First, Liquid covers transaction amounts and asset types and thus enables privacy.  Since Liquid features a 1-minute block time, transactions are registered in the network in less than three minutes.  This makes the network much faster than Bitcoin which requires ten minutes on average.  Finally, an inter-exchange settlement on Liquid enables its users to move funds in a fast and convenient manner.BTSE token",BTSE Token,BTSE,0x666d875c600aa06ac1cf15641361dec3b00432ef,https://www.btse.com/en/home/,https://www.btse.com/token/BTSE_Token_White_Paper_en.pdf,https://etherscan.io/token/0x666d875c600aa06ac1cf15641361dec3b00432ef,,https://www.twitter.com/btsecom,https://www.facebook.com/btsecom,https://www.reddit.com/r/btsecom,https://t.me/BTSEcom,,,,https://www.blog.btse.com/blog,,

"Zilliqa is a scalable, secure, high-performance public blockchain platform designed for creating decentralized apps.  This is the first platform of this kind to implement the sharding technology which aims to resolve the scalability issue inherent to all the Ethereum and Bitcoin-based projects.  The platform is fueled by a native utility token Zilling (ZIL) that participants pay for processing transactions or running smart contracts.  It is available for trading on top exchange platforms including Kraken, Bitfinex, Binance, and Huobi.  The total supply of ZIL equals to 21 billion.  The ICO started at the end of December 2018 and raised its full cap of 22 million USD worth of ether in a matter of a few days in a private funding round.  One of the biggest investors was Danhua Capital, a famous Chinese venture capital firm.  The team decided to cancel its plans for public token sale after that.  But the community interest motivated them to allocate 4445 ETH worth of ZIL for a public sake which helped them double the raised amount - in a matter of a few days as well.  An interesting fact is that Zilliqa’s team mostly comprises of computer specialists with the academic background.  The idea emerged as an R&D project developed by a group of enthusiasts from the National University of S...ingapore.  Before conducting an ICO, they had spent two years of hard work creating a functioning blockchain.  The project’s CEO Xinshu Dong and Chief Scientific Advisor Prateek Saxena stepped aside from active roles at the project and joined the Board of Directors in May 2019.  The former Crypto Lead and a co-founder of the project, Amrit Kumar, took the position of President and Chief Scientific Officer after that.  The project was initially launched on the Ethereum platform with ERC-20 tokens because the public mainnet had not yet been released by that time while the team needed funds to make their plans a reality.  Zilliqa conducted a token swap in January 2019.  Token swap is a mechanism that helps token owners convert ERC20 ZILs from the Ethereum network to native ZILs on the Zilliqa network at the rate of 1:1.  The ZIL token can be stored on a number of wallets with the Moon Wallet as the top recommendation from the developing team.  It is blockchain agnostic and supports both Zilliqa and Ethereum chains.  ZIL tokens are available for mining using a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol.  It means that the regular PoW is used to establish identity only when you start mining and in the specified timed intervals.  The rest of the time the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and an Elliptic Curve Based Schnorr Signature Algorithm with a discordant abbreviation of EC-Schnorr will be utilized.  Zilliqa launched its mainnet on January 31st, 2018, claiming that the new blockchain would be 1,000 times as fast as Ethereum that is only capable of verifying 19 transactions per second at the maximum.  First transactions on the platform were enabled in Q1 2019 with the smart contracts following quite soon after that in Q2.  The release of smart contracts’ functionality made it possible for developers to write and launch their own pieces of code.  Ethereum-based projects are based on the programming language named Solidity which has proved to be very complex and led to numerous mistakes in the dApps’ code and money losses (take the ill-famous DAO hack, for example).  To address Ethereum’s security issues and vulnerabilities, Zilliqa has invented its own language named Scilla.    Scilla-based smart contracts come with the following benefits: The new language comes with the built-in functionality that helps developers conduct regular checks to ensure that there are no bugs in the code and that it works just as planned. The built-in library of standard operations facilitating the developing progress. Different operational components such as communication with other contracts and computations are segregated in a pretty clear way.  This helps to protect dApps from hacking incidents similar to the one that happened with DAO.  It’s worth saying a few words about the sharding technology as well.  This is a scaling solution that implies splitting a database (a blockchain) into parts or shards and spreading the load across multiple servers.  One of the key issues, that Bitcoin and Ethereum ran into in 2017 with the drastic surge of cryptocurrencies’ popularity, was related to scalability.  These networks and all their derivatives are built in such a way that every transaction has to be confirmed by all the nodes running the network.  As the network grows, more verifications are needed which makes the system clumsy and inefficient.  The main idea behind the sharding technology is that each transaction does not necessarily have to be confirmed by all the nodes.  It’s enough to get confirmation from a limited number of participants.  A transaction confirmed by, let’s say, 100 participants (that make up a shard) will be just as secure as the one confirmed by 10,000.  Once a shard completes its job, the new transaction is linked to the main network.  This helps to verify transactions much faster and significantly reduces the network fees.  In theory, such an approach may help to verify a limitless number of transactions every second.  Although Zilliqa was the first one to implement it, it’s no longer the only one in the industry.  While Ethereum is slowly moving towards its final stage Serenity, many other projects have emerged and the scalability race is getting harder to win with every day.",Zilliqa,ZIL,zil1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq9yf6pz,https://zilliqa.com,,https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/address/zil1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq9yf6pz,,,,,,,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2367256,,,,

"Decred (DCR) is an open-source cryptocurrency launched in February of 2016.  Decred (short for Decentralized Credit) was created by crypto-enthusiasts concerned that Bitcoin’s decision-making was becoming too centralized due to the growth of Bitcoin mining pools.  Decred describes itself as “an autonomous digital currency” with “a strong focus on community input, open governance, and sustainable funding for development.”DCR utilizes a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to ensure that a small group of users can’t manipulate the flow of transactions or make sudden changes to the Decred protocol without the input of the community.  With a hybrid consensus algorithm, miners earn DCR for finding new blocks while Decred token holders can validate transactions to receive rewards as well as vote on network proposals.  This allows token holders to have input in the progression of the project.  Users who stake their Decred tokens receive a ticket that, when randomly selected, allow the ticket holder to act as a block validator.  With Decred, 60% of the block reward goes to Proof-of-Work miners, 30% to Proof-of-Stake voters, and 10% to fund the development of the protocol.  This is unlike Bitcoin where 100% of the reward goes to the PoW miners.",Decred,DCR,,https://decred.org/,,https://dcrdata.decred.org/,,https://twitter.com/decredproject,,,,,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1290358,,,,

"Enjin Coin (ENJ) is a cryptocurrency based on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard.  It is used primarily on the blockchain gaming platform with the same name for tokenizing in-game items and as a means of value exchange between players.    Enjin is a Singapore-based company that has been running its business in the gaming industry ever since 2009.  It has one of the biggest gaming platforms with the support of over 250,000 gaming communities and 20 million registered players.  In 2017, the company decided to switch its business to the blockchain rails in order to provide its users with such benefits as increased data security and irreversible transactions.  Enjin’s platform allows its users to tokenize in-game assets.  Gamers exchange virtual goods on the blockchain using the ENJ coin to conduct transactions.  The transparency provided by the blockchain allows gamers to easily verify the ownership of certain assets.  Also, the platform offers an effective solution to deal with fraud and prevents users from losing their belongings due to malevolent actions.  ENJ can be used across different games and communities eliminating the barriers between the participants.  Apart from ERC-20 tokens, the platform supports ERC-1155 smart contracts that can be both fungible and non-fungible helping user...s claim their ownership of unique gaming items.  In addition to the gaming platform, Enjin has developed a robust solution to help developers create their own blockchain-based games.

In March 2019, Enjin set up a partnership with Samsung to integrate its technologies into South Korean Galaxy S10 models.  This piece of news was highly discussed in the media and made the ENJ coin’s price skyrocket.  Also, Enjin has set up relations with such companies as Unity, PC Gamer, Arena Match, NRG eSports and a few others which can become a good contribution into the project’s success.  Enjin has a multi-national well-knit team standing behind it with proven experience in software engineering, business operations, and blockchain technologies.  Its CEO and Creative Director Maxim Blagov has been working on the project ever since its launch.  He has received a Computer Science degree at the University of Technology in Sydney.  Enjin’s CTO Witek Radomski has been helping Maxim grow the project ever since the foundation.  The decision to implement the blockchain technologies was made in 2017 when cryptocurrencies and ICOs were on the rise.  Enjin conducted its ICO in October 2017 and raised 12 million USD.  40% of tokens were distributed via Private Sale and the same amount was given away during a Public Sale soon after that with the remaining 20% staying in a reserve.  Half of the raised amount was invested in the product’s development and 30% - into marketing and growth.  The remaining sum was equally distributed for other needs such as security, hosting, legal support and contingency.  ENJ token is traded on many different exchange platforms including Binance, Bithumb, Bittrex, and HitBTC.  It can be stored on all ERC-20 compatible wallets such as Metamask and MyEtherWallet.  Hardware wallets Trezor and Anchos support it, too.  The official Enjin Wallet which is one of the project’s key viable products allows storing ENJ on Android and iOS-based mobile devices.",Enjin Coin,ENJ,0xf629cbd94d3791c9250152bd8dfbdf380e2a3b9c,https://enjincoin.io/,https://enjincoin.io/enjincoin_whitepaper.pdf,https://etherscan.io/token/0xf629cbd94d3791c9250152bd8dfbdf380e2a3b9c,https://github.com/enjin/contracts,https://twitter.com/enjincs,https://www.facebook.com/enjinsocial,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnjinCoin/,https://t.me/enjin_coin,,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2042871,https://medium.com/@enjin,,,
"Fueled by a native utility token HOT, Holochain develops a hosting platform that enables decentralized Holochain applications or hApps to serve mainstream internet users.  Holochain focuses on delivering scalable crypto-accounting infrastructure that allows hosting and maintaining these applications.  How Holochain works The key problem of the two most popular blockchain platforms Bitcoin and Ethereum that Holochain aims to resolve is scalability.  The architecture of these two platforms allows processing a pretty small number of transactions per second which prevents them from being adopted by mass audiences.In order to achieve scalability and process enormous numbers of users in a unit of time, Holochain replaces the global consensus with private forks that are maintained by separate agents with their own secure ledgers.  These forks are stored on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table allowing all the participants of the network to function in an independent way.  The data gets synchronized only when users deem that this is necessary.  At the same time, participants of the network do not remain in the vacuum and can still interact with each other.",Holo,HOT,0x6c6ee5e31d828de241282b9606c8e98ea48526e2,https://holo.host/,https://holo.host/whitepapers/,https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c6ee5e31d828de241282b9606c8e98ea48526e2,https://github.com/Holo-Host,https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_,https://www.facebook.com/holohost/,https://www.reddit.com/r/holochain/,https://t.me/channelholo,,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2963267,https://medium.com/h-o-l-o,,,
"NEM is a dual-layer blockchain similar to Ethereum but written in Java, a popular programming language; its native cryptocurrency is XEM. The platform describes itself as a ‘smart asset blockchain’ which allows developers to build a number of decentralized applications (dApps) for fintech, logistics, Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), and peer-to-peer payments.  NEM stands for New Economy Movement, the premise of the platform is that it combines learnings from other cryptos (such as Bitcoin) with academic research in network theory. Its key advantage is its modular Smart Asset System, which enables businesses to replicate almost any business transaction on the blockchain with minimal development. Because NEM was created using Java, most programs can be easily adapted to utilize the network. It is sometimes described as a blockchain-based cloud platform.  The founding vision of the protocol was to create a system that would give power to users, rather than coin hoarders and mining companies. One of the issues with the Proof of Work system used by Bitcoin (and many others) is that in order to mine tokens, you must use computational power; the greater your machine’s power, the greater the chance of earning coins.

"Bitcoin Gold (BTG) is a cryptocurrency created from a hard fork of Bitcoin (BTC).  Bitcoin Gold officially split from the original Bitcoin blockchain on October 24th, 2017. According to the website, the purpose of the Bitcoin Gold project is to restore the original decentralization of Bitcoin mining.  In the early days, Bitcoin (BTC) could be mined using regular computers.  That meant there were individual miners spread throughout the globe, each securing the platform.  However, as the network has grown, the only way to profitably mine BTC is to use ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits).  ASICs are different from CPUs and GPUs in that they do only one thing, but they do it very well.  The use of ASICs has led to a monopolization of Bitcoin mining where a few big companies dominate.  If some of these large mining companies wanted to, they could join forces and issue a 51 percent attack where they control a majority of the network hash rate giving them the power to revise transaction history and prevent new transactions from being confirmed.

"Terra is an open-source blockchain protocol that has been created on the basis of its old version also known as Terra Classic.  Initially launched in April 2019, the blockchain relies on the Terndermint protocol.  The system was initially fueled by two tokens: an algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and Luna (LUNA).  However, UST experienced a big price deviation as its value dropped from $1 to $0.01 over the course of 2021-2022.  As a result, the platform had to pass through a hard fork so as to reimburse investors’ losses.  At the time of writing, Terra 2.0 is powered by LUNA tokens while the old one features Terra Luna Classic (LUNC).The details of Terra Luna collapseTerra Luna was initially invented by Korean blockchain enthusiasts Do Kwon and Daniel Shin from Terraform Labs in 2018.  The initial goal was to create an algorithmic stablecoin that would be pegged to the price of fiat currencies such as USD, EUR, and South Korean won.  Unlike fiat-collateralized stablecoins, algorithmic ones are backed by digital assets which, in turn, rely on various algorithms to help them preserve a stable value.

"The Oasis Network is a scalable, privacy-focused blockchain platform built to expand DeFi to the mass market.  The Oasis Network mainnet was launched on November 18, 2020, with the purpose to provide a high level of scalability, low gas fees, and token monetization.  Oasis’ other key goal is to improve privacy protection for DeFi to become suitable for storing sensitive data.  To achieve it, the Oasis Network implements confidential smart contracts.To protect data privacy and prevent data leakage, nodes rely on a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) which works as follows.  The encrypted data first goes into the TEE where it gets decrypted.  After that, it is processed by the smart contract and gets encrypted again before going out of the TEE.  Oasis implements Parcel SDK as a bridge to help developers get the most out of the privacy solutions.  It allows users to automatically implement data ownership and analyze data.

"The Golem Network Token (GNT) is an ERC-20 token that Golem ecosystem participants can use for exchanging value between each other.  This is a utility token as it can only be used within the dedicated system.  Developers use GNT tokens to pay for resources and application usage while requesters compensate providers with their help.  The main idea behind the project is to combine the power of multiple users’ machines across the globe so as to create an open-source decentralized supercomputer.  The Golem platform represents a distributed cloud that aims to provide application owners with access to the computing resources that can be used for resolving complex computational tasks such as video rendering.  It can be particularly useful for those who’s machines don’t have enough capacity for performing such tasks and need additional power to speed up the process.  The Golem platform is an open-source decentralized marketplace for computing power that can be controlled by its users.  It offers an alternative to huge cloud providers with their closed networks, expensive patented solutions, and hard-coded provisioning operations.    Those who want to become part of this network can loan their computers’ spare resources (CPU or GPU) to others who need extended computational power.  Golem ...utilized the same principles of sharing economy that underlie such services as Uber and AirBnb.  Small PC owners and large data centers, anyone can join and earn GNT tokens.  It offers a simple way to make extra money by sharing your unused resources or to get access to cheap computing power.  The key target audience of the Golem Network comprises of dApps’ developers, businesses working with large amounts of data, scientists working in the same area and technicians working on machine learning.    Golem’s roadmap consists of the following key milestones: Brass Golem.  This is a proof-of-concept stage with the key focus on rendering. Clay Golem.  At this stage, implementing the Task API and Application Registry is the key addition aimed to provide developers with full integration with the platform.  Also, the team plans to implement machine learning and support sandboxing on virtual machines. Stone Golem.  This stage is aimed at stabilizing and securing the network.  The proposed functionality includes Full Task API, support for SaaS and application registry. Iron Golem.  This is the final stage giving developers the freedom to create applications outside of the sandbox.  According to the project’s whitepaper, the technology will be fully tested by that time and will be able to gain interest outside of the cryptocurrency field.  It’s worth noting that Golem is not the only project of such kind in the industry.  Their nearest competitor is iExec with the focus on off-chain computations.  BOINC and SOMN do something similar as well, but Golem’s team believes that there is still enough space for everyone.  Golem conducted the Initial Coin Offering in November 2016 and raised 820,000 ETH (~8 million USD at that time) in 20 minutes.  12% of tokens were held by the project and 6% more were distributed across early investors and team members.

"0x (ZRX) is an open protocol that provides infrastructure used to build decentralized exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain.  The 0x project utilizes off-chain transaction relayers and smart contracts to accomplish this.  Users of the protocol pay relayers with the native ZRX token.  In addition, the ZRX token is used for decentralized governance over the protocol’s upgrade system.  ZRX token holders have a voice in how the protocol should be improved over time depending on how many tokens they own.ZRX is an ERC-20 token and as such can be stored in any Ethereum wallet.0x aims to solve the inefficiencies of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.  Although decentralized exchanges are great at security, they lag behind centralized exchanges in user operational costs (higher gas fees) and accessibility (slow). The 0x protocol makes decentralized exchanges better by employing off-chain ordering relays together with on-chain settlements.  This allows users to broadcast an order off-chain that another user can fill.  It is only after a value transfer is executed that it is written on-chain, leaving all other trading commands to off-chain procedures.  Transactions are only run on the network when a trade is performed, allowing users to decrease their gas fees when trading.",0x,ZRX,0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498,https://0x.org/,https://0xproject.com/pdfs/0x_white_paper.pdf,https://etherscan.io/token/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498,https://github.com/0xProject,https://twitter.com/0xproject,,https://reddit.com/r/0xproject,,,,,https://blog.0xproject.com/latest,,

When a user uploads data to the Sia platform, it’s encrypted, divided into several smaller components, and stored on nodes all over the world.  The only way to access the data is to decrypt it with the user’s private keys.The Sia network utilizes storage smart contracts where both the “host” (storage provider) and “renter” (user uploading data) lock up some Siacoin in a smart contract escrow along with a transaction fee that the renter pays.  After a specified time chosen by the renter, the system automatically checks to see if the data is still available from the host.  If the host is offline or loses the encrypted data, they forfeit their staked Siacoins in the escrow account.

"NDAU is the first digital currency optimized for a long-term store of value.  The idea of the project has emerged from the need for a more “conservative crypto” such as Bitcoin or Ethereum which have high volatility.  At the same time, less volatile stablecoins have no growth and in the case of long-term investment can become deflationary.  To address this conflict, NDAU’s monetary policy stabilizes the value while its pre-determined price curve increases the value of the assets when demand grows.  Thus, NDAU allows its users to store their coins long-term and earn more tokens when demand grows.  The project was founded in 2017 by Oneiro, a US-based global provider of high-performance blockchain solutions and technologies.  One more company standing behind the project is Endowment, a not-for-profit organization that serves as a mechanism for the Blockchain Policy Company to enact the project’s monetary policy.Holding and earning funds in NDAU",Ndau,NDAU,,https://ndau.io,,https://ndau.io/explorer,,https://twitter.com/ndaucollective,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ndau/,https://t.me/ndau_community,,,,,,
"Secret is a blockchain network with privacy-preserving smart contracts which became the first solution of this kind.  The Secret Network project sees its mission in providing privacy tools for smart contracts in contrast to many other blockchains, where smart contracts are public by default.  The network supports encrypted inputs, outputs and states for smart contracts.  In the form of a formula, Secret characterizes itself as a combination of Ethereum smart contracts, Monero’s privacy by default, and Cosmos’ scalability and interoperability.  The blockchain was first launched as the Enigma mainnet blockchain in February 2020 in the United States.  The Secret Network itself was introduced in May 2020 with a new name, web properties and ways to be involved in the ecosystem.  Holders of Enigma tokens could exchange them at a 1:1 ratio for SCRT tokens.  At the time of writing, Enigma continues to support the development of Secret Network.Secret technology",Secret,SCRT,,https://scrt.network/,,https://secretnodes.com/,,https://twitter.com/secretnetwork,,,https://t.me/SCRTcommunity,https://discord.com/invite/SJK32GY,,,https://blog.scrt.network/,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZPqj7h7mzjwuSfw_UWxQPw,

"PEOPLE is a token fueling the Constitution DAO, a project running on the Ethereum blockchain.  Constitution DAO was created in November 2021 with the brave goal of collecting money to purchase the United States Constitution.  In total, they managed to raise $47 million USD from around 17,000 enthusiasts in one week.  The PEOPLE tokens gave their holders the opportunity to vote for what actions the project should take in the future.  Although the project technically had enough money to win the Sotheby’s auction, it couldn’t afford to take proper care of the document in case of winning.  After the Constitution DAO lost the auction the team said that they would close the project and refund contributions minus the Ethereum system fees.  As a result, some of the investors had to face disappointment due to market volatility.  In addition, the Ethereum fees remain pretty high at the time of writing.  Therefore, many project supporters lost a considerable percentage of their contributions.Constitution DAO ",ConstitutionDAO,PEOPLE,0x7a58c0be72be218b41c608b7fe7c5bb630736c71,https://www.constitutiondao.com/,,https://etherscan.io/token/0x7a58c0be72be218b41c608b7fe7c5bb630736c71,,https://twitter.com/constitutiondao,,,,https://discord.com/invite/p2jdESeVfy,,,,,

"Tribe is a governance token that was created to control the DAO similar to COMP.  The issuer of the token is the Fei platform created on the basis of the Fei Protocol with the dual token model that utilizes a Uniswap liquidity provider as an official market.  The goal of the Fei protocol is to maintain a liquid market where ETH/FEI trades closely to the ETH/USD price.  Fei employs a homemade stability mechanism that the developers named as ‘Direct Incentives’.  Along with dynamic mint rewards and burn penalties on DEX trade volume, direct incentive stablecoins were used to maintain the peg.  The Fei community employs a governance scheme to solve a number of issues such as the appointment of minter and burning contracts, adjustment of scale target, and allocation of rules on bonding curves, etc.  Fei ProtocolThe platform fueled by Fei Protocol is fully decentralized.  The protocol includes several core components to build the system such as Fei Core, the FEI stablecoin, the Tribe governance token, DAO, the bonding curves, PCV (protocol-controlled value) deposits, and PCV controllers.
