"Bitcoin (₿) (BTC) is a decentralized virtual digital currency that can be sent between users through the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, without the need for intermediaries like banks or governments. It was the first example of a cryptocurrency, a growing asset class that shares some characteristics of traditional currencies, but has verification based on cryptography.  The term ‘Bitcoin’ can refer to the token (a snippet of code that represents ownership of a digital value) or it can refer to the technology (a distributed network that maintains the ledger of balances of the Bitcoin token).  The idea for Bitcoin and blockchain was first published in an online cryptography forum in November 2008, by an anonymous person (or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto. The white paper, entitled ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ outlined an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof, and explained how the different parts of the Bitcoin protocol would operate and be kept secure. It further described how a new type of database called a blockchain would keep track of the history of all Bitcoin transactions, and be maintained by everyone in the network.

"Ether (ETH) (Ξ) is a cryptocurrency whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum network. Unlike Bitcoin, which aims to disrupt the banking system with its own digital currency, the Ethereum platform’s goal is to use blockchain to replace internet third parties, particularly those that store data, transfer mortgages, and keep track of complex financial instruments. Ethereum is open-source, public, and highly programmable. Anyone can use or modify its software to build upon the computing platform and operating system. The platform gives developers the opportunity to build their own digital assets on the Ethereum infrastructure without having to create their own blockchain. This has given rise to hundre...ds of Ethereum blockchain based tokens (such as Binance Coin, Golem, and Basic Attention Coin). In 2017, at the height of crypto-mania Ethereum was leading blockchain platform for Initial Coin Offering  (ICO) projects, with over 50% market share.

"Tether (₮) (USD₮) is a cryptocurrency with digital tokens designed to replicate the value of the United States Dollar. The theory is that this provides protection from the volatility of cryptocurrencies, so 1 USD₮ will always be worth $1. To achieve this Tether claims to have each token backed 100% by actual assets in the platform’s reserve account.  The origins of Tether came from a whitepaper published online in January 2012, in which software developer J.R. Willett described the possibility of building new currencies on top of the Bitcoin protocol. Credited with ‘inventing the ICO’ to fund the project, Willett went on to implement his idea in the form of the ‘Mastercoin’. The Mastercoin protocol became the technological foundation of the Tether platform. Tethers exist on blockchains using the Omni Protocol, and as ERC20 tokens.  Two original members of the Mastercoin Foundation, Brock Pierce and Craig Sellars, became co-founders of Tether. Former child actor, Brock was a minor partner in a digital entertainment network that raised $88 million in venture capital in the 1990s. In 2013, he joined brothers Bart and Bradford Stephens in founding the venture capital firm Blockchain Capital (BCC) which was reported to have raised $85 million in two venture funds by October 2017.

"USD Coin (USDC) is an asset-backed stablecoin pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio.  Each USD Coin is collateralized with a US dollar that is held in regulated financial institutions which are monitored and audited on a monthly basis.  USDC is an alternative to other US dollar-backed cryptocurrencies like Tether (USDT) and TrueUSD (TUSD).USDC was created and launched in September 2018 by CENTRE, an open-source consortium developing a decentralized network of fiat stablecoins.  CENTRE was co-founded in 2017 by Circle and Coinbase.  (Circle is a peer-to-peer payments technology company founded by Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville in October 2013 and Coinbase is a popular cryptocurrency exchange founded in June 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam.)  The goal of CENTRE is to develop price-stable cryptoassets, handle governance, and create network protocols for USDC and other fiat-backed stablecoins.

"Binance Coin (BNB) is a cryptocurrency issued by the popular trading platform Binance. The coin runs natively on the Ethereum blockchain and follows the ERC20 technical token standard. It is classified as a utility token and can be used on the Binance exchange.  In July 2017, Binance held an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for BNB which helped it to raise $15 million. During the ICO process, the company offered 10% of the total number of coins (BNB 20 million) to angel investors, 40% (BNB 80 million) to the founding team, and the remaining 50% (BNB 100 million) to other participants. Holders of the BNB coin are referred to as Binancians.

"XRP is the native digital asset of the Ripple platform. Ripple aims to connect banks and payment providers to provide a frictionless experience for sending and receiving money globally. It was originally designed as a day-to-day payment system, to speed up and reduce the costs of transactions, and provide a mediatory currency for exchanges and conversions with minimum commission.  Software developer Ryan Fugger founded the original Ripple project in 2004. The core idea behind the protocol was a peer-to-peer trust network of financial relations that would replace banks. Based on the premise that money is simply a bank’s promise of value, he aimed to create a monetary system where the promise of an individual held just as much weight. His concept was launched in 2005 as RipplePay, a financial service allowing users to extend credit lines to friends and family and make secure payments in traditional and online currencies.

"Dogecoin (DOGE) is a blockchain-based peer-to-peer cryptocurrency which was created in December 2013, as a tongue-in-cheek riposte to Bitcoin, and the crypto world generally. Its branding featured a likeness of a Shiba Inu dog from a ‘Doge’ meme that was popular at the time. By January 2014, it had quickly and unexpectedly generated a large community following and had reached a market capitalization of $60 million.  The idea for Dogecoin was conceived by Jackson Palmer, a marketer at Adobe Systems in Sydney, who tweeted a joke concept combining two of the internet's most talked-about topics: cryptocurrency and Doge. Billy Markus, a Portland, Oregon-based gaming geek and IBM software developer, made the concept a reality. According to Markus, it took him about three hours to create Dogecoin.  Markus based Dogecoin on an existing cryptocurrency, Luckycoin, which features a randomized reward that is received for mining a block, although this was later changed to a static block reward in March 2014. In turn, Luckycoin is based on Litecoin, which also uses scrypt technology in its proof-of-work algorithm.

"Launched in 2017, Cardano is a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project which is fully open source and was built to support the creation of decentralized financial applications (dApps). It claims to have more advanced features than any protocol developed and to have the first currency to evolve out of scientific philosophy, academic theory, and peer-reviewed research. Appropriately, the platform takes its name from Gerolamo Cardano, an Italian polymath who is regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of the Renaissance.  The native cryptocurrency of Cardano is called Ada (ADA), named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician (and daughter of Lord Byron) who is often referred to as the first computer programmer. The currency is integrated natively into Cardano’s settlement layer, making it an essential part of the platform; however, this is something that Cardano reportedly intends to supersede.

This network allows smart contracts on the Ethereum platform to securely connect to external data sources, payment systems, and application program interfaces (APIs) that exist outside the blockchain.Although smart contracts (agreements between two parties written in computer code) have tremendous potential, the underlying consensus mechanisms of blockchain technology make it so smart contracts are unable to communicate with external data systems.  Some smart contracts can’t execute without off-chain information (e.g., a price fluctuation for a specific asset).  To solve this issue, oracles are used.An oracle finds and verifies real-world events and submits this data to smart contracts on the blockchain.  Although oracles help, they also present another point of concern: oracles are centralized third-party sources.  A user must trust that the oracle is providing accurate data.  This is called the “oracle problem.”",ChainLink,LINK,0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca,https://chain.link/,https://link.smartcontract.com/whitepaper,https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca,,https://twitter.com/chainlink,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chainlink/,https://t.me/chainlinkofficial,,,,https://blog.chain.link/,,
"UNI is a governance token issued by the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Uniswap. This is an automatic market maker working on the basis of smart contracts that create a liquidity pool for ERC20 tokens and implement the algorithm without using the orderbook. The official upgrade to Uniswap V2 took place in May 2020. The launch period coincided with the popularity of the yield farming that also contributed to the bigger popularity of the exchange.Uniswap token platformThe launch of the platform took place in November 2018 by Hayden Adams who developed the service being inspired by the article published by Vitalik Buterin a year earlier. After contributing to a Uniswap liquidity pool, users get a pool token that also belongs to the group of ERC20 tokens. They have the same properties as other ERC20 tokens allowing users to exchange and sell them. It’s possible to use them in other dApps as well. Each token is a tiny share of the liquidity pool with a trading fee of 0.3% included.

"Cosmos (ATOM) is a decentralized network of independent blockchains, each powered by Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms.  Atom is the native staking token of the Cosmos Network.  The Cosmos vision is to build an “internet of blockchains” that can scale and interoperate with one another.  Open source tools like Tendermint Core, the Cosmos SDK, and the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC) were created to accelerate the creation of blockchains in the Cosmos Network.Tendermint Core is a BFT consensus algorithm.  With the Tendermint consensus algorithm, users get “instant finality,” which means forks are never created as long as more than a third of the Validators are honest.  Transactions are finalized as soon as a block is created (unlike proof-of-work blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum).The Cosmos SDK is a generalized framework that simplifies the process of building secure blockchain applications on top of Tendermint Core.  IBC is a protocol that connects independent blockchains together.  IBC allows heterogeneous chains to transfer value or data to each other and can work with any “fast-finality” blockchain engine.",Cosmos,ATOM,,https://cosmos.network/,,https://www.mintscan.io/,,https://twitter.com/cosmos,,https://reddit.com/r/cosmosnetwork,https://t.me/cosmosproject,,,https://blog.cosmos.network/,,https://www.youtube.com/c/CosmosProject,
"Monero (XMR) is a secure, private, and untraceable digital currency. Although it offers the option of transparency, it is typically known for its use of privacy technologies such as ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and stealth addresses to obscure the origins, amounts, and destinations of transactions.  You can buy Monero from an exchange or from an individual. Alternatively, you can mine Monero to get coins from the block reward. Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol. Unlike Bitcoin, where people can see exactly how much money is being sent from one user to another, Monero hides this information to protect user privacy. Monero also features a dynamic block size and dynamic fees, an ASIC-resistant proof of work, and a tail coin emission.  Monero’s Kovori is an anonymized router which integrates I2P technology and has been under development since 2015. The project will improve the privacy of the network by hiding the IP addresses of those who wish to interact with the Monero blockchain.  Due to the stringent privacy features, Monero experienced rapid market capitalization growth in 2016, far surpassing that of other cryptocurrencies. This was reportedly due to its adoption by the darknet market and rightwing extremists.

"Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a second generation blockchain, a network, a community, and a cryptocurrency. In addition to allowing people to send amounts of value to each other, ETC allows for complex contracts that operate autonomously and cannot be modified or censored.  Both Ethereum Classic and Ethereum (ETH) have a value token called ‘Ether’, which can be transferred between participants, stored in a cryptocurrency wallet, and used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed on the Ethereum Platform.  The Ethereum concept was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer in late 2013. Development was funded by an online crowdsale that took place between July and August 2014, with the Ethereum system going live on 30 July 2015.  Two years after Ethereum’s launch there was a hack which caused a split in the community, often described as a ‘battle of ethics and ideology’. The victims were investors in a fund called the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), which was launched by the Ethereum community as a decentralized investment fund for smart contract projects.

"Stellar is a platform that connects banks, payments systems and people, helping them to move money across borders at almost no cost. It acts as a bridge facilitating the low-cost trading of fiat currencies, particularly in cases where there might not be a large direct market.  The native asset of the Stellar network is the Lumen (XLM). Lumens are used to pay transaction fees on the platform and act as a security measure that mitigates DoS attacks that attempt to generate large numbers of transactions or consume large amounts of space in the ledger. The asset also plays an anti-spam role, as all user accounts must hold a minimum of 0.5 Lumen, discouraging abandoned accounts and ensuring that they all have economic utility.  In 2014, when the network launched, the native asset was also called ‘Stellar’ but was renamed ‘Lumen’ in 2015 to prevent confusion. The supply of Lumens is governed by strict protocol-level rules. At launch 100 billion were created and every year new Lumens are added to the network at an inflation rate of 1%.  The platform and development of the network are run by the Stellar Development Foundation, a non-profit and non-stock fund.

"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. It’s a permissionless, decentralized cryptocurrency that requires no trusted third parties and no central bank. It was created in 2017 after the Bitcoin community split in two (or hard-forked) over scalability issues. The plan for a Bitcoin alternative was pushed through by Bitcoin activists, investors, entrepreneurs, developers, and largely China-based miners. It was considered to be one of the most successful hard-forks of the original Bitcoin. At the time of the fork, anyone owning Bitcoin was also given the same number of Bitcoin Cash units.  Bitcoin Cash increases the size of blocks, allowing for more transactions to be processed.

The developers can create their businesses on the basis of the Flow blockchain and use the apps to control their data.Flow platformFlow features a four-node architecture that helps to speed up transaction processing and makes it less expensive improving hardware capacity as well.  Speed and cost-effectiveness are achieved without compromising the decentralization.  It also doesn’t require breaking up the network into layers or shards for smooth performance.  The split of consensus from computing helped the developers to increase throughput considerably without loss of security.

"Originally designed as an Ethereum staking solution, the Lido decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) was established on December 19, 2020.  Later it turned into a decentralized staking platform supporting ETH 2.0, Terra, Solana, Kusama, and Polygon.  The other cryptocurrencies were added later as well.  At the time of writing, this is the market leader for Ethereum liquid staking that takes a great share of all staked ethers.The project offers a simplified and secure staking option for digital assets, in which the annual percentage rate (APR) depends on the chosen token.  Rewards are proportional to the size of the user's stake compared to the total amount of the locked coins while the balances are updated on a daily basis.  The minimum deposits for staking are not defined, and participants are not required to maintain the platform’s infrastructure which significantly reduces the entry barriers for newcomers.

"Bitcoin SV is short for Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV) and is a cryptocurrency that claims to be closer to the original Bitcoin template as envisioned by its creator. The idea for Bitcoin and blockchain was first published in an online cryptography forum in November 2008, by an anonymous person (or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto.  The white paper, entitled ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ outlined an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof, and explained how the different parts of the Bitcoin protocol would operate and be kept secure. It further described how a new type of database called a blockchain would keep track of the history of all Bitcoin transactions, and be maintained by everyone in the network.  Bitcoin was first released as version 0.1 in January 2009, by Satoshi and was published on SourceForge, an online collaboration platform for developers. In 2017, the Bitcoin community split in two (or hard-forked) over scalability issues and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created which increased the size of blocks, allowing for more transactions to be processed.

"Synthetix develops a blockchain-based payment network fueled by a stable coin aiming to combine all the benefits of a decentralized approach with the stability of traditional financial assets.  In order to reach stability, the project implements a dual token solution that consists of a stabilized Ethereum-based utility token SNX and a reserve token Nomin to back it.  Nomin is pegged to the value of 1 USD and is used to make transactions on the platform.  Previously known as Havven, the project was rebranded in November 2018, and now bears the name of Synthetix.  It is fueled by a native ERC-20 cryptocurrency SNX.On the Synthetix platform, SNX tokens serve to stabilize and collateralize the system, while their holders get the transactions fees.  The size of payouts depends on their contribution to the stability of the Nomin token.  SNX token holders place their assets in an escrow account in order to issue Nomins, as the total value of SNX in escrow is always bigger than the value of Nomins in circulation.  The collateral ratio of nomins to SNX equals to 1:5.  This helps to ensure that nomins can always be redeemed for their face value even if the price of SNX dramatically drops.",Synthetix Network Token,SNX,0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f,https://www.synthetix.io/,https://www.synthetix.io/uploads/havven_whitepaper.pdf,https://etherscan.io/token/0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f,https://github.com/havven/havven,https://twitter.com/synthetix_io,,https://www.reddit.com/r/synthetix_io/,,,,,https://blog.synthetix.io/,,

The initial project dates back to 2017 when the fork took place and the new cryptocurrency started developing separately from the original one.  After several splits that followed, the fork went on developing as Bitcoin ABC until it rebranded into eCash with a ticker XEC on July 1, 2021.ECash has integrated a PoS (proof-of-stake) consensus layer “Avalanche” that shouldn’t be confused with the Avalanche blockchain.  With that, the project has enabled enhanced security, instant confirmation of transactions, and easier network upgrades that give huge potential to the platform.The mission that eCash developers declare on their website is to “redefine wealth”, i.e.  to enable freedom, privacy, and the power of your own voice.  For that, the platform attempts to build global electronic cash that should become an alternative to other means of electronic payments.

It does this by providing an information and transfer system with a protocol that allows near instantaneous, scalable, and secure transactions. The coin is sometimes listed and referred to as MIOTA, which refers to a million IOTA.  The most striking difference about the IOTA platform, compared to others, is that it uses a new distributed ledger technology and quantum-proof protocol, called the Tangle. Instead of the traditional blockchain, Tangle technology uses a method known in mathematics as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Whereas blockchain is a sequential chain of blocks in which each block references its chronological predecessor, similar to a linked list, with DAG technology each transaction (rather than a block of transactions) references two previous transactions, forming not a linked list, but a complex web structure.

It was one of the first digital currencies to feature a decentralized blockchain governance system. It rebranded again in March 2015; its new name is an amalgamation of the words ‘digital cash’.  The coin was created as a result of a Bitcoin fork in an attempt to improve on efficiency, speed, and anonymity. It is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, claiming to be the perfect option for people who are not interested in cryptocurrency. Transactions have low fees and are much faster than Bitcoin.  Dash coins are obtainable through mining, running the network as a masternode, or by exchanging them for other tokens and fiat currencies. Anyone can form a masternode if they hold 1000 Dash in collateral. If a miner is willing to perform advanced functions (such as increased privacy and instant transactions) they can earn a 45% block reward.

"Nexo platform was created in 2017 by Credissimo, a leading European FinTech Group located in Bulgaria, to provide crypto-backed loans.  Nexo became their technological innovation with a unique opportunity to use cryptocurrency owners’ holdings.  It offers a business model when cryptocurrency holders use their assets as collateral to get instant loans.  In fact, Nexo has created an instant crypto loan system based on blockchain technologies.The peculiarities of the NEXO usageInstant crypto loans represent the key product offered by Nexo.  In order to get a loan, a user needs to create a Nexo wallet and to upload crypto assets there.  These crypto assets will be treated as collateral eliminating the need to pass any credit checks or other verification procedures.  At the same time, Nexo also gives its users an opportunity to earn an 8% interest on most popular fiat currencies (USD, EUR, and GBP) as well as on some stable coins.

"Zilliqa is a scalable, secure, high-performance public blockchain platform designed for creating decentralized apps.  This is the first platform of this kind to implement the sharding technology which aims to resolve the scalability issue inherent to all the Ethereum and Bitcoin-based projects.  The platform is fueled by a native utility token Zilling (ZIL) that participants pay for processing transactions or running smart contracts.  It is available for trading on top exchange platforms including Kraken, Bitfinex, Binance, and Huobi.  The total supply of ZIL equals to 21 billion.  The ICO started at the end of December 2018 and raised its full cap of 22 million USD worth of ether in a matter of a few days in a private funding round.  One of the biggest investors was Danhua Capital, a famous Chinese venture capital firm.  The team decided to cancel its plans for public token sale after that.  But the community interest motivated them to allocate 4445 ETH worth of ZIL for a public sake which helped them double the raised amount - in a matter of a few days as well.  An interesting fact is that Zilliqa’s team mostly comprises of computer specialists with the academic background.  The idea emerged as an R&D project developed by a group of enthusiasts from the National University of S...ingapore.  Before conducting an ICO, they had spent two years of hard work creating a functioning blockchain.  The project’s CEO Xinshu Dong and Chief Scientific Advisor Prateek Saxena stepped aside from active roles at the project and joined the Board of Directors in May 2019.  The former Crypto Lead and a co-founder of the project, Amrit Kumar, took the position of President and Chief Scientific Officer after that.  The project was initially launched on the Ethereum platform with ERC-20 tokens because the public mainnet had not yet been released by that time while the team needed funds to make their plans a reality.  Zilliqa conducted a token swap in January 2019.  Token swap is a mechanism that helps token owners convert ERC20 ZILs from the Ethereum network to native ZILs on the Zilliqa network at the rate of 1:1.  The ZIL token can be stored on a number of wallets with the Moon Wallet as the top recommendation from the developing team.  It is blockchain agnostic and supports both Zilliqa and Ethereum chains.  ZIL tokens are available for mining using a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol.  It means that the regular PoW is used to establish identity only when you start mining and in the specified timed intervals.  The rest of the time the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and an Elliptic Curve Based Schnorr Signature Algorithm with a discordant abbreviation of EC-Schnorr will be utilized.  Zilliqa launched its mainnet on January 31st, 2018, claiming that the new blockchain would be 1,000 times as fast as Ethereum that is only capable of verifying 19 transactions per second at the maximum.  First transactions on the platform were enabled in Q1 2019 with the smart contracts following quite soon after that in Q2.  The release of smart contracts’ functionality made it possible for developers to write and launch their own pieces of code.  Ethereum-based projects are based on the programming language named Solidity which has proved to be very complex and led to numerous mistakes in the dApps’ code and money losses (take the ill-famous DAO hack, for example).  To address Ethereum’s security issues and vulnerabilities, Zilliqa has invented its own language named Scilla.    Scilla-based smart contracts come with the following benefits: The new language comes with the built-in functionality that helps developers conduct regular checks to ensure that there are no bugs in the code and that it works just as planned. The built-in library of standard operations facilitating the developing progress. Different operational components such as communication with other contracts and computations are segregated in a pretty clear way.  This helps to protect dApps from hacking incidents similar to the one that happened with DAO.  It’s worth saying a few words about the sharding technology as well.  This is a scaling solution that implies splitting a database (a blockchain) into parts or shards and spreading the load across multiple servers.  One of the key issues, that Bitcoin and Ethereum ran into in 2017 with the drastic surge of cryptocurrencies’ popularity, was related to scalability.  These networks and all their derivatives are built in such a way that every transaction has to be confirmed by all the nodes running the network.  As the network grows, more verifications are needed which makes the system clumsy and inefficient.  The main idea behind the sharding technology is that each transaction does not necessarily have to be confirmed by all the nodes.  It’s enough to get confirmation from a limited number of participants.  A transaction confirmed by, let’s say, 100 participants (that make up a shard) will be just as secure as the one confirmed by 10,000.  Once a shard completes its job, the new transaction is linked to the main network.  This helps to verify transactions much faster and significantly reduces the network fees.  In theory, such an approach may help to verify a limitless number of transactions every second.  Although Zilliqa was the first one to implement it, it’s no longer the only one in the industry.  While Ethereum is slowly moving towards its final stage Serenity, many other projects have emerged and the scalability race is getting harder to win with every day.",Zilliqa,ZIL,zil1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq9yf6pz,https://zilliqa.com,,https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/address/zil1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq9yf6pz,,,,,,,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2367256,,,,
"Rocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking pool that is designed specifically to support ETH stakers.  It was launched in late 2016 and passed through a number of powerful public betas along with the development of ETH2.  The main goal of Rocket Pool is to become the primary staking infrastructure for Ethereum.Rocket Pool consists of 3 basic elements: Smart Contracts, Smart Nodes, and Minipool Validators.  The project demonstrates some innovative features like a tokenized staking deposit, low minimum deposit amounts, unlimited deposit size, deposit safety mechanisms.  The assets can be locked for 6, 9, and 12 months.  You can receive up to 6.36% annual return in ETH and variable RPL rewards as a node operator, or around 4.77% APR as an ETH staker.The work of the entire infrastructure is based on two groups of network participants: stakers and node operators.  Rocket Pool enables interested individuals, businesses, decentralized applications, etc.  to provide their users with the opportunity to earn staking rewards without the necessity to maintain staking infrastructure using the Beacon Chain.  The minimum deposit amount for end-users equals 0.01 ETH.  Those who want to run a node in Rocket Pool need to deposit 16 ETH and provide permanent uptime.",Rocket Pool,RPL,0xd33526068d116ce69f19a9ee46f0bd304f21a51f,https://www.rocketpool.net/,https://www.rocketpool.net/files/RocketPoolWhitePaper.pdf,https://etherscan.io/token/0xd33526068d116ce69f19a9ee46f0bd304f21a51f,https://github.com/rocket-pool,https://twitter.com/Rocket_Pool,,https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketpool/,,https://discordapp.com/invite/tCRG54c,,https://medium.com/rocket-pool,,,
